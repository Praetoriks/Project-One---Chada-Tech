# Project-One---Chada-Tech

1.) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Developing an object-oriented programming (OOP) application to create two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input using secure and efficient C++ code. 

2.) What did you do particularly well?
I feel that I performed the task as a whole particularly well. If I am being specific, I feel that I was able to achieve the desired effect with a not overtly large amount of code. It could be much further condensed, but I feel that it accomplished its task.

3.) Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
The user interface can be greatly enhanced to make something that a user would actually use instead of something that would never see the light of day in our current age. 

4.) Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The piece of code that was most challenging to write was the base clock calculations, not because the actual code was challenging, but because it was very convoluted in organization. I overcame this by being very precise about the line and bracket organization. 

5.) What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skills from this project that will be transferable to other projects is pretty much all encompassing as this a very basic framework for working object-oriented programming in C++.

6.) How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program readable by giving clear comments as to what each section did, it is so small and simple that it is by virtue, very easily adaptable and maintainable.
